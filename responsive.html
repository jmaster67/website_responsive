	<h1>Wings and Beer</h1>

		<h2>Budweiser</h2>
		<img src="bud.jpg">
			<p> Idolphus Busch left Germany for the United States in 1857. He settled in St. Louis, Missouri, where he eventually established his own brewing supply house. In St. Louis, Busch also met and married Lilly Anheuser. Lilly’s father, Eberhard Anheuser, owned a small brewery that had been making lager beer for some time. In 1864, Busch partnered with his father in-law to form what would eventually become the Anheuser-Busch Company.</p>

			<p> Busch traveled extensively in Europe to observe and study the latest brewing techniques. In the 1870s, Anheuser-Busch became the first American brewery to implement pasteurization, which greatly improved the shelf-life and transportability of its beers. In the mid-1800s, most Americans preferred robust, dark ales. Busch had encountered lighter lager beers during his travels and began brewing a light Bohemian lager. Anheuser-Busch introduced this lager in 1876 under the brand name Budweiser.</p>

			<p>Budweiser and Anheuser-Busch had two decades of growth, before the onset of prohibition in 1920. Anheuser-Busch had to retool their line of products to survive during the years of prohibition. This included selling a low alcohol "near beer," brewer's yeast, malt extract, and other raw materials that could be used for home brewing</p>

			<p>When prohibition came to an end in 1933, Anheuser-Busch began brewing Budweiser again. During prohibition, the palate of the beer consumer had changed due to the popularity of sweeter homemade and bootlegged brews. The company dared consumers to drink Budweiser for five days, and if on the sixth day, they still preferred the taste of other beers, they could go back.</p>

		<h2>Heineken</h2>
		<img src="heineken.jpg">
			<p> Gerard Adriaan Heineken bought "De Hooiberg" (The Haystack) brewery in Amsterdam on February 15, 1864. In 1873, the HBM (Heineken's Bierbrouweij Maatschapij) was established, and the first beer is brewed, with the brewery's name being changed from Haystack to Heineken. In 1875, Heineken won the Medaille D'Or at the International Exposition in Paris, then began to be shipped there regularly. Heineken sales topped 64,000 hectolitres (1 hectolitre = 26.418 U.S. gallons) and it was the biggest exporter to France. In 1889, Heineken receives the gold medal of honour at the World Exhibition in Paris. In 1990, Heineken received a special Jury Prize in Paris.</p>

			<p>ince 1975, most Heineken brand beer has been brewed at the Heineken brewery in Zoeterwoude, Netherlands.[1] In 2011, 2.74 billion liters of Heineken brand beer was produced worldwide, while the total beer production of all breweries fully owned by the Heineken Group over all brands was 16.46 billion liters globally.[7] Sold in more than 170 countries, Heineken is the world's most international premium beer. It has been incorporated with numerous beer brands from different countries all over the world including, Mexico, China, and Africa.</P>

		<h2 style="color:green">Guiness</h2>
		<img src="guiness.jpg">
			<p> Guinness is an Irish dry stout that originated in the brewery of Arthur Guinness 1725–1803 at St. James's Gate, Dublin. Guinness is one of the most successful beer brands worldwide. It is brewed in almost 60 countries and is available in over 120 sales total 850 million litres 1.5 billion Imperial or 1.8 billion US pints</p>

			<p>A feature of the product is the burnt flavour that is derived from roasted unmalted barley, although this is a relatively modern development, not becoming part of the grist until the mid-20th century. For many years a portion of aged brew was blended with freshly brewed beer to give a sharp lactic flavour. Although the Guinness palate still features a characteristic "tang", the company has refused to confirm whether this type of blending still occurs. The draught beer's thick, creamy head comes from mixing the beer with nitrogen when poured. It is popular with the Irish both in Ireland and abroad, and, in spite of a decline in consumption since 2001,[3] is still the best-selling alcoholic drink in Ireland where Guinness & Co. makes almost 2 billion annually.</p>

		<h2 h2 style="color:red">Buffalo</h2>
		<img src="buffalo.jpg">
			<p>There are several different claims about how Buffalo wings were invented.</p>

			<p>One of the more prevalent claims is that Buffalo wings were first prepared at the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, New York, by Teressa Bellissimo,[3][4] who owned the bar with husband Frank. Several versions of the story have been circulated by the Bellissimo family and others:</p>

			<p>Upon the unannounced, late-night arrival of their son, Dominic, with several of his friends from college, Teressa needed a fast and easy snack to present to her guests. It was then that she came up with the idea of deep frying chicken wings (normally thrown away or reserved for stock) and tossing them in cayenne hot sauce.</p>

			<p>A cook preparing Buffalo wings
			Dominic Bellissimo (Frank and Teressa's son) told The New Yorker reporter Calvin Trillin in 1980: "It was Friday night in the bar and since people were buying a lot of drinks he wanted to do something nice for them at midnight when the mostly Catholic patrons would be able to eat meat again." He stated that it was his mother, Teressa, who came up with the idea of chicken wings.</p>
			
			</p>There was mis-delivery of wings instead of backs and necks for making the bar's spaghetti sauce. Faced with this unexpected resource, Frank Bellissimo says that he asked Teressa to do something with them.
			However, a long article about the Anchor Bar in a local newspaper in 1969 does not mention Buffalo wings.</p>

			<p>Another claim is that a man named John Young served chicken wings in a special "mambo sauce" at his Buffalo restaurant in the mid-1960s. His wings were breaded. Young had registered the name of his restaurant, John Young's Wings 'n Things, at the county courthouse before leaving Buffalo in 1970.</p>

			<p>Marketing materials for Frank's RedHot claim that it was the hot sauce used in the Bellissimos' original recipe.</p>

		<h2>Bar-b-Q</h2>
		<img src="bbq.jpg">
			<p>Barbecue chicken consists of chicken parts or entire chickens[1] that are barbecued, grilled or smoked. There are many global and regional preparation techniques and cooking styles. Barbecue chicken is often seasoned or coated in a spice rub, barbecue sauce, or both. Marinades are also used to tenderize the meat and add flavor. Rotisserie chicken has gained prominence and popularity in U.S. grocery markets. Barbecued chicken is one of the world's most popular barbecue dishes.</p>

			<p>In North America, barbecue chicken is often seasoned with a spice rub, then coated with a tomato based barbecue sauce, and grilled. Some versions only use a spice rub and don't use sauce.[14] Barbecue chicken can also be prepared in pressure cookers, in which the chicken is cooked inside the cooker with barbecue sauce, and in slow cookers.</p>

		<h2>Korean</h2>
		<img src="kw.jpg">
			<p>Korean fried chicken or seasoned chicken yangnyeom chicken is a fried chicken dish prepared in a Korean style. It is consumed as a meal, fast food at bars, or as an after meal snack in Korea.</p>

			<p>Korean fried chicken differs from typical American fried chicken by being fried twice. This results in the skin being crunchier and less greasy. Furthermore, Korean-style chicken is not characterized by the crags and crusty nubs associated with American fried chicken as described by Julia Moskin of The New York Times as a "thin, crackly and almost transparent".[1] The chickens are usually seasoned with spices, sugar, and salt, prior to and after being fried. Korean fried chicken restaurants commonly use small- or medium-sized chicken, in other words, younger chickens resulting in more tender meat. Afterwards, the chicken is usually hand painted with a brush, to evenly coat the chicken with a thin layer of sauce. Pickled radishes, beer, and soju are often served with Korean fried chicken.</p>
